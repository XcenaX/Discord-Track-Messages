# Discord-Track-Messages

The program tracks a specific person in a specific Discord chat and as soon as he writes a message
it is copied and sent to this chat, and then the program closes. Can be configured so that the program
did not close after one message
Itâ€™s also better not to set TRACK_FOREVER and your nickname, the program will not work correctly
